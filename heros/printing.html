                <p>Andreas Vesalius followed an unorthodox method to complete his illustrations for De Humani Corporis Fabrica.
                    Rather than having his illustrations completed in Venice, the city in which the blocks were cut for
                    printing, Vesalius chose to send the illustration blocks to Basel, Johannes Oporinus. In doing this, Vesalius
                    eased his intense concerns about the piracy of his book. Vesalius wanted the book to define his reputation, and
                    as such, he knew that by printing in Basel, his book would reach northern Europe before pirated copies would
                    saturate the market. 
                    <br><br>
                    By prioritizing the quick delivery of his books, Vesalius ensured that his reputation
                    would not be hampered by the low quality of production associated with pirated copies. Vesalius was successful
                    in his unusual production process, and the illustrations within De Humani Corporis Fabrica would lay the foundation
                    for the study of anatomy.
