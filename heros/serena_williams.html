                <h1>SERENA WILLIAMS</h1>
                <p>Serena Williams, one of the most famous women's tennis players of all time, founded a
                    San Francisco based investment firm - Serena Ventures. Transitioning from an all-time
                    great tennis player into running a venture capitalist firm is an impressive pivot that
                    takes an incredible amount of drive and passion. Serena plans on investing in products
                    that will aid in closing the racial wealth gap. 
                    <br><br>
                    For example, Lili RNB, a retail fraud detection service run by African American CEO
                    Barbara Jones received 3 million dollars in funding from Serena Ventures. Such investments
                     will help close racial and gender disparities as they relate to tech and digital experiences.
