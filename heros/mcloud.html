                <h1>ANDREW MCCLOUD</h1>
                <p>Andrew McCloud is currently a Senior Front End Engineer working at Abstract. 
                    At the age of 18, McCloud created Splicd. Splicd gave users of Youtube the ability to
                    generate a link to a specified time on a Youtube video. Nowadays, the feature is offically
                    implemented, but McCloud was the first to bring forth the feature. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although, this feature seems small, it gave many users some extra quality of life
                    when using Youtube. What seems like a small feature now possibly led to the newer feature we see today
                    such as the timestamp feature many Youtube videos share, allowing users to easily get to the 
                    more important parts of the videos.
