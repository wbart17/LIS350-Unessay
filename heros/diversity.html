                <h1>DIVERSITY AND UNIFORMITY</h1>
                <p>Anatomistâ€™s of the 15th and early 16th century disregarded the importance of analyzing
			anatomical variability. In 1559, Realdo Colombo, an Italian surgeon, widespread
			the idea that anatomical anomalies are incredibly rare, and as such, should not
			be an emphasis of study. Tall, middle-aged men were the primary demographic for
			anatomical research and dissections. Going against the grain, Andreas Vesalius
			heavily considered this issue of representation within his book De Humani Corporis
			Fabrica. 
			<br><br>
			By analyzing bodies from different demographics, Vesalius was able to
			categorize anatomical diversity among ethnic groups due to their differences in
			cartilage, bones, and muscles. This categorization may have allowed society a
			more encompassing perspective on what is considered natural for the human body (Siraisi 62).
