                <h4>Disection</h4>
                <p>Andreas Vesalius was one of the first to dissect
                    <br> human bodies. In doing so, Vesalius created some
                    <br> of the first accurate illustrations of human anatomy.</p>

                <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                <p>De Humani Corporis Fabrica
			        <br> is regarded as the cornerstone of modern anatomy.
			        <br> Vesalius accurately depicted the human body
				<br> nearly half of a millennium ago!</p>

                <h4>The human heart</h4>
                <p>Andreas Vesalius was the first to identify the two
                    <br> chambers and atria of the human heart. This discovery
			        <br> laid the foundation for our understanding of its functions.<p>

            <h3>What is this About</h3>
            <p>Two of us, Justin and Sreeram, had an interview over Zoom introducing ourselves
                and talking about people of color in tech that recently inspired us. William joined
                our group for this project as he was unable to find a partner for assignment #1.
                Often times the spotlight does not shine on people who have very inspirational
                stories and are people of color.
                <br><br>
                During the interview we talked about how one does not have to reinvent the wheel
                in regards to technology to better peoples lives. Sometimes it is just about adding
                some quality of live for the people using the technology.
                <br><br>
                Some issues we ran into for the interview were some camera issues leading to a less
                personal interview as one person could not have their camera on. Additionally, it was
                difficult to find some in depth information for some of the POC heros as they are not
                constantly interview like some of the more well known leaders in tech.
