                <h4>Dissection</h4>
                <p>Andreas Vesalius was one of the first to dissect
                    <br> human bodies. In doing so, Vesalius created some
                    <br> of the first accurate illustrations of human anatomy.</p>

                <h4>The Human Heart</h4>
                <p>Andreas Vesalius was the first to identify the two
                    <br> chambers and atria of the human heart. This discovery
			        <br> laid the foundation for our understanding of its functions.<p>

            <h3>Why Did I Choose This Book?</h3>
            <p>During our class visit to the Special Collections in Memorial Library, I was
		    immediately in awe with De Humani Corporis Fabrica. The first thing to catch
		    my attention was the size of the book (dimensions: 15 9/16 x 10 1/2 x 3 1/4 in).
		    The book is set in pigskin and holds 700 pages. Even more fascinating to me
		    were the illustrations. Within the book, there are many illustrations, such
		    as the one above, which encompass the entire page. The details, such as the
		    striations within the muscles, the bone structure, and the accurate depiction
		    of organs blew me away. I could not believe that a book published over 500
		    years ago possessed such intricate and accurate detail, in addition to the
		    fact that it has remained in overall good condition. After viewing several
		    of Vesalius's illustrations, I knew that I needed to learn more.
